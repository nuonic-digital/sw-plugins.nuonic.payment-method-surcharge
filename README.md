# Payment method surcharge

If you want to add a percentage surcharge to the shopping cart for certain payment methods, you can do this with this extension. Within the settings for this plugin, there is a multi-select box in which you can select the payment methods for which the surcharge should apply. Below this, you then have the option of entering a percentage value that should be applied as a surcharge for the selected payment methods.

Currently, it is only possible to define a fixed surcharge for different payment methods.

The surcharge that we calculate from the net shopping cart is displayed as a separate item within the checkout on the confirmation page, so that the customer can clearly see that this surcharge belongs to the selected payment method.

**Application examples:**

*   B2B stores that have separate agreements with their customers
*   Stores that charge static surcharges for certain payment methods
